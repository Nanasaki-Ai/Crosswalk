# Overview

- We introduce a novel traffic monitoring dataset, *Crosswalk*, which not only encompasses integrated pedestrian and vehicle interactions but also specifically detects instances where vehicles fail to yield to pedestrians.

- We propose a effective analytical framework to comprehend pedestrian-vehicle dynamics, facilitating the detection of specific violation incidents.

  ***Overview of the violation detection process, organized into two stages.***
  *In the first stage, a tracker identifies vehicles of interest by detecting bounding box intersections within a predefined region, enabling the localization of event boundaries.
   In the second stage, an attention mask is applied to the relevant video segments, which are then processed by a two-pathway model to classify the presence of a violation.*

# Crosswalk

## Dataset Introduction

 This dataset originates from continuous 24-hour live-streams of a specific intersection in Bangkok, captured from a fixed overhead perspective on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbBKbDwlR0E).
 
 It consists of 10 hours of footage, divided into **120** untrimmed videos, recorded between November 2023 and May 2024.
 
 Video numbers range from **video_001.avi** to **video_120.avi**. All videos are **five minutes** long.
 
 These videos feature the same traffic scene under various weather conditions and times of day.
 
 Focusing on **two** crosswalks, the dataset captures vehicles moving bidirectionally, entering and exiting the frame via the left and right boundaries.
 
 To reduce extraneous background activity, the recordings were confined to areas of interest, yielding a final video resolution of 1200√ó1100 pixels at 30 fps.

 We will **make the dataset fully available for download** after **the manuscript is accepted**. Now you can reproduce our method in two ways:

 - Download a video (514MB) from the dataset and continue. You can download the data through [Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KAySJ_DNrKo6M6l0_Si7nw?pwd=cpgd) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16By0jyQPQsdZpp_oTwgnEppsrpBTTYox/view?usp=drive_link).

 - You can **directly download our preprocessed data for reproduction**.

## Dataset Annotations

You can download the violation event annotations through [Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1aoJLJUT-A7H4jO1Luzsp9w?pwd=6l8r) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pKrevRdrWC7-hDcp8O-jYVJMv-YMPayW/view?usp=sharing).

We define **an interaction event** as **the period during which a vehicle enters or exits the crosswalk area concurrent with a (or several) pedestrian's presence**.

As a result, we have meticulously annotated approximately **7.7k** pedestrian-vehicle interaction events.

The *Crosswalk* dataset comprises two categories of pedestrian-vehicle interaction events: violations and non-violations, totaling 1972 and 5752 events, respectively.

In this work, **event-level** annotations are used as they effectively reflect the instance situation.

The annotations are stored in JSON files, generated using **Labelme**, where the file names correspond to the frame numbers at which the events occur. 

Each JSON file contains two key data, namely **class**, **points** and **group_id**.

- **class** indicates whether a vehicle violates the rule of giving way to pedestrians during the event.
  
  **class** is **0 for a violation** and **1 for no violation**.

- The bounding box coordinates are recorded under **points**, capturing the **key vehicle's location as it enters and exits the crosswalk**.

  The bounding box coordinates of the vehicle in the form of **(top left x, top left y, bottom right x, bottom right y)**.

- **group_id** uniquely identifies the event number for pedestrian-vehicle interactions at the crosswalk, distinguishing it from other events.

  If a vehicle passes through two crosswalks with pedestrians present, it corresponds to two distinct events.

  Each event will be associated with a unique pair of group_ids, representing the annotations for the respective events.

For instance, if a vehicle enters the area of interest at frame **1301** and leaves at frame **1501**, and fails to yield to pedestrians during this time, two JSON files will be created: **00001300.json** and **00001500.json**. Meanwhile, Both json files have the same **group_id** and **class (0)**.

*Convert event annotations in json format to txt text. Run:*

`python json_to_txt.py`

It is recommended to put these files in a folder as follows, and you can also **modify the path**.

        -annotations\
          -video_001\
            -00000291.json
            -00000377.json
            ...
          -video_002
          ...
          -video_120
        -json_to_txt.py

For a certain event of a certain vehicle ùí±, the format of the txt file is:

        -group_id
        -2
        -1 / The frame number in which ùí± enters the crosswalk / 0 / The bounding box when ùí± enters the crosswalk
        -2 / The frame number in which ùí± leaves the crosswalk / 0 / The bounding box when ùí± leaves the crosswalk

## Evaluation Criteria

To evaluate the model's generalization and robustness, we designed two distinct cross-validation benchmarks: **cross-video** and **cross-scene**.

- **Cross-video evaluation.** We sequentially numbered 120 video segments, with snippets from odd-numbered videos used for training and even-numbered for testing. This method evaluates the model's ability to generalize across diverse video sequences.

- **Cross-scene evaluation.** Under this benchmark, events from the upper crosswalk area were assigned to the training dataset, while events from the lower area were allocated to testing. This approach assesses the model's capability to recognize violations across varied traffic scenarios.

## Dataset Preparation

We divide the video into frames, which is also an important pre-step for subsequent preprocessing.

*Take video_001.avi as an example and divide it into frames:*

`pip install video-cli`

`video-toimg video_001.avi`

# Event Awareness Method

The overall steps include:
**Tracking** ‚Üí **Filtering** ‚Üí **Localization**

**To demonstrate the output at each step, we have prepared separate Python files corresponding to nearly every stage of the process.** 

You can *follow them sequentially* or *download our preprocessed files* for quick reproduction.

## Tracking

### Pretrained Detector

To accurately detect objects of interest in traffic scenes, we use **YOLOv8** for pre-training on additional annotated datasets.

We recommend using the provided [dataset](https://app.roboflow.com/nnu-hi7if/nnu_intersection/7) for object detector training or utilizing the trained model parameters.

Please install the environment according to the official website of [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/README.md).

All models were trained on an RTX 4090. You can use our **pretrained weights** or train the model yourself.

You can download the weights through [Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1XhjA8IiR8zNuU3blHsymEQ?pwd=z8fl) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fPra_scgzv_RP1yKMQ83HdyWiVFyeYkc?usp=sharing).

*Training a detector from scratchÔºö*

`yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8m.pt data=intersection_images/data.yaml epochs=100 imgsz=640`

YOLOv8 has five variants: -n, -s, -m, -l, -x. The "model" parameter can be modified to specify the variant to use.

We recommend using **-m** as it achieves better results on the auxiliary dataset.

### Tracking pedestrians and vehicles

You can **skip this step** by downloading the **tracking data** (430MB) we preprocessed earlier.

You can download the tracking data through [Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1niuto7cPNf1DqRzpr8h0LQ?pwd=teou) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rwJ9bXvbW7czSOqD_2WHxHweK7PadzZF/view?usp=sharing).

Make sure you have **downloaded the dataset and pretrained weights**.

In addition, the **[operating environment](#pretrained-detector)** of YOLOv8 also needs to be configured.

It is recommended to **put these files in a folder as follows**, and you can also **modify the path**.

        -intersection-video\      # The Crosswalk dataset
          -video_001.avi  
          -video_002.avi
          ...
          -video_120.avi
        -detector_weight\         # The detector weight
          -m\          
            -weights\
              -best.pt
        -tracking.py

*Next, the tracker is called to sequentially process the video:*

`python tracking.py`

The program takes several hours to run completely. You will get the following in the same file:

        -tracking.py
        -tracking_output\  
          -video_001.txt  
          -video_002.txt
          ...
          -video_120.txt

These txt files contain the raw tracking data.

## Filtering

*Filter the original trajectory to identify the vehicle IDs of interest:*

`python filtering_1.py`

You can **skip this step** by downloading the **data** (62MB) we preprocessed earlier.

You can download the data through [Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1NY9l_OWqlPoGjJXLiPhoCQ?pwd=lq1p) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dbJPFLjdewRFxvqY_KOMwKh-FoD4wBnn/view?usp=sharing).

## Localization

*Next, use the vehicle IDs identified in the previous stage, determine the time when each vehicle enters and exits the crosswalk:*

`python filtering_2.py`

You can **skip this step** by downloading the **data** (65MB) we preprocessed earlier.

You can download the data through [Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ANqBnCyIplW-DCj-e2f9gw?pwd=pit3) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rBsdkhpgCxxTE-xbToJRY7jkWnFSdUND/view?usp=sharing).

*Then, generate the detection value in txt format:*

`python filtering_3.py`

Assume that the key vehicle in the detected event is ùí±ùíπ, its format is similar to the ground truth:

        -track_id
        -2
        -1 / The frame number in which ùí±ùíπ enters the crosswalk / 0 / The bounding box when ùí±ùíπ enters the crosswalk
        -2 / The frame number in which ùí±ùíπ leaves the crosswalk / 0 / The bounding box when ùí±ùíπ leaves the crosswalk

You can **skip this step** by downloading the **data** (610KB) we preprocessed earlier.

You can download the data through [Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pSkRGPJDVL0-rX19NRC33A?pwd=n0lk) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JCwaziKEMoWawvzuc8Oy2M0VPM7wy9OX/view?usp=sharing).

# MAN

## Feature Extraction

For the pedestrian-vehicle interaction events of interest, we construct **two** types of representations:

**video representation (VR)** and **refined representation (RR)**.

<hr style="width:20%;text-align:center;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">

 <p align="center">
  <img src="demo/VR.gif" alt="Stage #3" width="300"/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <img src="demo/RR.gif" alt="Stage #5" width="300"/>
</p>
 <p align="center">
  <em><strong>Feature visualization.</strong> Left: Video representation. Right: Refined representation.</em>
</p> 

<hr style="width:20%;text-align:center;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">

### VR Generation

*Construct the video representation from the original video:*

`python preprocessing_vr.py`

You can **skip this step** by downloading the [VR features](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1JVXRf5kXREh3a1REQBJwUQ?pwd=m4r4) (11.9GB)

### RR Generation

Generate refined representations based on raw video and tracking data.

***First**, generate grayscale images that are consistent with the length and width of the original video frame and retain the position of pedestrians:*

`python background_removal_att.py`

You can **skip this step** by downloading the **data** (3GB) ([Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KOMPo5z3BxNEmknNRjhccg?pwd=h0a1) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XtTEBXPn_PMUlBVZx58V1vZ59Or9xaFD/view?usp=sharing)) we preprocessed earlier.

***Then**, according to the key vehicle of each event, its position is represented in the grayscale sequence with a brightness different from that of pedestrians.*

`python preprocessing_rr.py`

You can **skip this step** by downloading the **refined features** (410MB) ([Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/13Dpw9sfgvsDdlwnGUtXGgw?pwd=1esm) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gZCSWD1AC2dtdrcC1bP3U5KqjTvPZ1sX/view?usp=sharing)) we preprocessed earlier.

## Label Generation

The generated snippets consist of 32 downsampled images, named using the format **V**xxx**I**xxxxx**S**x**D**x**R**x**A**x (where x represents a number).

Let's take **V001I00002S1D0R0A1** as an example to explain the naming convention:

- **V** indicates the video number. For example, **V001** refers to video_001.
- **I** denotes the tracking ID of the key vehicle in each event. Here, **I00002** means that the vehicle's tracking ID is 2.
- **S** stands for the scene number. **S1** represents the lower crosswalk area, while **S0** indicates the upper crosswalk area.
- **D** specifies the vehicle's direction, indicating whether it is moving up or down, i.e., driving on the left or right side of the lane. In Thailand, vehicles typically drive on the left; **D0** represents down (right), and **D1** represents up (left).
- **R** shows whether data augmentation was applied. In this case, all samples are **R0**, indicating no data enhancement.
- **A** indicates whether the event is legal or illegal. **A0** denotes a violation, while **A1** indicates compliance.

## Training and Testing

After completing the preprocessing, the main program can be called for training and testing.

It is recommended to **put these files in a folder as follows**, and you can also **modify the path**.

        -main.py
        -dataset_reader_man.py      # Load the preprocessed data.
        -model_man.py               # Call the model and give it arguments
        -model                      # Modelzoo
        -label                      # Label file

        -tra_att_volumes_region     # RR
        -rgb_volumes_region         # VR
        ...

*When training an MAN from scratch, run:*

`python main.py`

You can use the model we have trained for testing. The [model](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1-doUH8tVlqMzRaUqd-qGUw?pwd=hcqv) is specially for **cross-scene** evaluation.

Please **calculate AP** after predicting the illegal/non-violation scores. Please refer to the next step for specific operations.

You can also modify the parameters to call other models for training and testing.

## EIoU and AP

For each event, we get two scores (violation and non-violation) during the test phase.

For MAN, we take the category corresponding to the maximum score.

For other models, we adopt the strategy of late fusion, and the scores of RR and VR are respectively input into the network for weighted fusion.

On this basis, we calculate **AP** based on the **EIoU** of each detected event and the ground truth.

In this work, **the threshold of EIoU** is set to **0.5**. 

That is, for each real event, **the EIoU of the detected event must be greater than the threshold** and **the predicted category must be correct** to be judged as **a successful detection**.

Each annotated event can **only be retrieved once**.

Therefore, for the predicted score, calculating AP requires **two** steps.

*The **first** step is to calculate the EIoU between the detected event and the ground truth:*

`python eiou_cal.py`

*The **second** step is to calculate AP based on the EIoU and whether the predicted category is accurate:*

`python ap_cal.py`

*Calculate the AP after score fusion:*

`python ap_cal_fushion.py`
